  <h1>Super Magic School of Awesome</h1>

  <p>"To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!" How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? <span class="attribute">Innocent blood</span> had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there was no atonement; but though <span class="attribute">forgiveness</span> was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one. Indeed, what right had <span class="attribute">Basil</span> to have spoken to him as he had done? Who had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.</p>

  <p>On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each step. He thrust up the trap and called to the <span class="attribute">man</span> to drive faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse <span class="attribute">madly</span> with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.</p>

  <p>The way seemed <span class="attribute">interminable</span>, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider. The <span class="attribute">monotony</span> became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he felt afraid.</p>

  <p>Then they passed by lonely <span class="attribute">brickfields</span>. The fog was lighter here, and he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away <span class="attribute">in the darkness</span> some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.</p>
