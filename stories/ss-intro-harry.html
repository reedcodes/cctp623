<p>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but <span class="attribute name">Harry</span> had always been small and skinny for <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj">his</span> age. <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">He</span> looked even smaller and skinner than <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">he</span> really was because all <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">he</span> had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's and Dudley was about four times bigger than <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">he</span> was. <span class="attribute name">Harry</span> had a thin face, knobby knees, black hair and bright-green eyes. <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">He</span> wore round glasses held together with a lot of Sellotape because of all the times Dudley had punched <span class="attribute pronoun-object">him</span> on the nose. The only thing <span class="attribute name">Harry</span> liked about <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj">his</span> own appearance was a very thin scar on <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj">his</span> forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning. <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">He</span> had had it as long as <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">he</span> could remember and the first question <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">he</span> could ever remember asking <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj">his</span> Aunt Petunia was how <span class="attribute pronoun-subject">he</span> had got it.</p>
<p>"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask questions."</p>
<p><em>Don't ask questions</em> &#8212; that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as <span class="attribute name">Harry</span> was turning over the bacon.</p>
<p>"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.</p>
<p>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that <span class="attribute name">Harry</span> needed a haircut. <span class="attribute name">Harry</span> must have had more haircuts than the rest of the <span class="attribute change kids">boys</span> in <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj">his</span> class put together, but it made no difference, <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj">His</span> hair simply grew that way &#8212; all over the place.</p>
