<p><span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> would at least meet <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span> and <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span>'d have lunch, when someone yelled <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj harry">his</span> name and <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> turned.</p>

<p>"<span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>! <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>!"</p>

<p>They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor &#8212; <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span> looking incredibly freckly, <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> very brown, both waving frantically at <span class="attribute pronoun-object harry">him</span>.</p>

<p>"Finally!" said <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span>, grinning at <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> as <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> sat down. "We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and &#8212;"</p>

<p>"I got all my school stuff last week," <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> explained. "And how come you knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?"</p>

<p>"Dad," said <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span> simply.</p>

<p>Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.</p>

<p>"Did you <em>really</em> blow up your aunt, <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>?" said <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> in a very serious voice.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to," said <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>, while <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span> roared with laughter. "I just &#8212; lost control."</p>

<p>"It's not funny, <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span>," said <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> sharply. "Honestly, I'm amazed <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> wasn't expelled."</p>

<p>"So am I," admitted <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>. "Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested." <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> looked at <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span>. "Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me off, does he?"</p>

<p>"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?" shrugged <span class="attribute name ron">Ron</span>, still chuckling. "Famous <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to <em>me</em> if I blew up my aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first, because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span>'s there as well!"</p>

<p><span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> nodded, beaming. "Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things."</p>
