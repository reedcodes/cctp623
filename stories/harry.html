<p>"Meet you in the common room," <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> muttered as Professor Trelawney's voice called, "<span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> Potter!"</p>

<p>The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> cough as <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for <span class="attribute pronoun-object harry">him</span> before a large crystal ball.</p>

<p>"Good day, my dear," she said softly. "If you would kindly gaze into the Orb... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it..."</p>

<p><span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> could, willing it to show <span class="attribute pronoun-object harry">him</span> something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.</p>

<p>"Well?" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. "What do you see?"</p>

<p>The heat was overpowering and <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj harry">his</span> nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">He</span> thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.</p>

<p>"Er &#8212;" said <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>, "a dark shape... um..."</p>

<p>"What does it resemble?" whispered Professor Trelawney. "Think, now..."</p>

<p><span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> cast <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj harry">his</span> mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.</p>

<p>"A hippogriff," <span class="attribute pronoun-subject harry">he</span> said firmly.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. "My <span class="attribute child harry">boy</span>, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> firmly.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Professor Trelawney urged <span class="attribute pronoun-object harry">him</span>. "Are you quite sure, dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?"</p>

<p>"No!" said <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span>, starting to feel slightly sick.</p>

<p>"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?"</p>

<p>"No!" said <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat. "It looks fine, it's &#8212; flying away..."</p>

<p>Professor Trelawney sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there... A little disappointing... but I'm sure you did your best."</p>

<p>Relieved, <span class="attribute name harry">Harry</span> got up, picked up <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj harry">his</span> bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind <span class="attribute pronoun-object harry">him</span>.</p>
