<p>"What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to <span class="attribute name hermione"><span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span></span>, "is more <em>time</em>."</p>

<p>"But &#8212;" <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> began. And then <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj hermione">her</span> eyes became very round. "Oh!"</p>

<p>"Now, pay attention," said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very clearly. "Sirius is locked in Professor Fliwick's office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, both of you: <em>You must not be seen</em>. <span class="attribute title hermione">Miss</span> Granger, you know the law &#8212; you know what is at stake... <em>You &#8212; must &#8212; not &#8212; be &#8212; seen</em>."</p>

<p>Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door.</p>

<p>"I am going to lock you in. It is &#8212;" he consulted his watch, "five minutes to midnight. <span class="attribute title hermione">Miss</span> Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck."</p>

<p>"Good luck?" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. "Three turns? What's he talking about? What are we supposed to do?"</p>

<p>But <span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> was fumbling with the neck of <span class="attribute pronoun-poss-adj hermione">her</span> robes, pulling from beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.</p>

<p>"Harry, come here," <span class="attribute pronoun-subject hermione">she</span> said urgently. "<em>Quick!</em>"</p>

<p>Harry moved toward <span class="attribute pronoun-object hermione">her</span>, completely bewildered. <span class="attribute pronoun-subject hermione">She</span> <span class="attribute pronoun-being-past hermione">was</span> holding the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparking hourglass hanging from it.</p>

<p>"Here &#8212;"</p>

<p><span class="attribute pronoun-subject hermione">She</span> had thrown the chain around his neck too.</p>

<p>"Ready?" <span class="attribute pronoun-subject hermione">she</span> said breathlessly.</p>

<p>"What are we doing?" Harry said, completely lost.</p>

<p><span class="attribute name hermione">Hermione</span> turned the hourglass over three times.</p>
